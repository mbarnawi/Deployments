# Results 
- RFM
  * The pie chart provides a succinct summary of customer segmentation results achieved through RFM analysis, displaying how customers are distributed across distinct segments.

- Cluster
  * The pie chart offers a succinct summary of customer segmentation results by showcasing how customers are distributed across various clusters.

- Cohort
  * The image displaying monthly cohorts retention provides a visual representation of how different cohorts of customers retain over time. The chart typically consists of a grid or heatmap, where each row represents a specific cohort (customers acquired in a particular month), and each column represents a subsequent month.

  * The image displaying monthly cohorts average sales provides a visual representation of the average sales generated by different cohorts of customers over time. The chart typically consists of a line or bar graph, where each cohort represents customers acquired in a specific month, and each point or bar represents the average sales amount.

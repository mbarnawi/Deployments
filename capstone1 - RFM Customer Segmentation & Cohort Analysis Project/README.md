<img src="https://github.com/mbarnawi/DL_Portfolio/blob/main/Churn%20Prediction%20for%20Bank%20Customer/img/gender.PNG" width=600>
The objective of this project is to utilize an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to accurately predict customer churn. By comprehending and forecasting customer behavior, businesses can proactively implement strategies to retain customers and enhance their services.

### note
In the first version, class weight is not applied, whereas in the second version, class weight is applied.
